\section{Research + Employment}

\subsection{Researcher and TA, University of Illinois at U-C
            \hfill Nov. 2018 -- *}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item \textbf{Hirata Group, 2019--*}: Furthering development of a novel
		stochastic technique in the evaluation of higher-order
		perturbation energies for very large molecular systems, termed
		\emph{Monte Carlo perturbation theory}.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Successfully performed extensive re-factoring of
				existing C++ code.

			\item Implementing various numerical techniques
				including quadrature rules, the control variates
				method, and the explicit RK4 method via the
				NumPy Python library.

			\item Parsing, processing, and interpreting large sets
				of binary data via the NumPy and pandas Python
				libraries.

			\item Metaprogramming scripts that automatically write
				and queue other job scripts to be run on the
				Blue Waters supercomputer at the NCSA.
		\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{TA for Phys.\ Chem.\ I, 2019--2020}: Taught an
		introductory course in quantum mechanics to 60+
		junior/senior-level undergraduates with my advisor Professor
		Hirata.

	\item \textbf{Jain Group, 2018--2019}: Characterized the superionic
		properties of twin-domain Cu$_2$S nanocrystals via electronic
		impedance spectroscopy and furthered development of
		next-generation batteries.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Medical Scribe, OSF Heart of Mary Medical Center ED \hfill May.\ 2019 -- Jun.\ 2020}
