\section{Objective}
Looking to apply my abilities as a scholar in Chemistry and programming to other
fields.

\section{Education}
\subsection{University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign \hfill Exp.\ May 2020}
James Scholar, B.S.\ in Specialized Chemistry -- 3.9 GPA as of Dec.\ 2019
\subsubsection{Relevant Coursework}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Phys.\ Chem.\ I + II, Inorg.\ \& Org.\ Chem.\ I + II, Instrumental
	Char., Quant.\ Analysis.

	\item Core Math \& Phys.\ curricula:\ Lin.\ Alg., Diff.\ Eq., Calc.\
	I-III, Univ.\ Mech., E+M, Q.\ Mech.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{duPont Manual High School \hfill May 2018}
Valedictorian, National Merit Finalist. SAT 1570/1600, ACT 35/36.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item\textbf{Apr.\ 2016}: Placed 2nd in Undergraduate Neuroscience
	Convention at the Univ.\ of Louisville.
\end{itemize}

\section{Research + Employment}
\subsection{Medical Scribe, OSF Heart of Mary Medical Center ED
	    \hfill May.\ 2019 -- *}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Documented medical charts for ED physicians using the Epic EMR
	system. Learned to enjoy working in a stressful, hectic environment
	while building relationships with successful ED physicians, while
	gaining introductory medical knowledge.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Researcher and TA, University of Illinois at U-C
            \hfill Nov. 2018 -- *}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item \textbf{TA for Phys.\ Chem.\ I, *}

	\item \textbf{Hirata Group, 2019-2020}: Performing electronic structure
	calculations of molecular dimers via a C++ implementation of the Monte
	Carlo MP2 theory developed in the Hirata group.

	\item \textbf{Jain Group, 2018-2019}: Characterized the superionic
	properties of twin-domain Cu$_2$S NCs to engineer solid-state
	electrolytes and further development of next-generation batteries.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Intern, Amprius Corporation \hfill May -- Jul. 2019}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Wrote Python scripts for cleaning and processing several GB of
	numerical data produced daily by the company's several automated battery
	cyclers. CSV parser is posted on github.
\end{itemize}

\section{Ability}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Practical, direct experience with numerical/computational analysis
	in conjunction with statistical modelling through a diverse portfolio
	ranging from C/C++ implementations of theoretical calculations of
	molecules in respective quantum states, to Python and R scripts written
	to optimize lithium-ion battery cycling performance, to LaTeX
	typesetting of publication-ready articles.

	\item Able to understand and solve problems involving complex, abstract
	concepts such as those that form the basis of our interpretation and
	calculation of optical and chemical phenomena, including MO theory,
	perturbation theory, and electronic structure theory.

	\item Beyond capable of self-learning any field. Entirely self-taught in
	programming and usage of UNIX-like distributions since age 16, with
	relevant experience to demonstrate ability nearly equivalent to that of
	a major in CS.  Self-taught Calc.\ III, Diff.\ Eq., Univ.\ Mech, E+M,
	and Q.\ Mech. prior to taking university proficiency exams.

	% \item Trained in advanced laboratory techniques ranging from operation
	% of gloveboxes and Schlenk lines to nanocrystal hot-injection synthesis
	% and powder X-ray diffraction.
\end{itemize}

\section{Involvement and Honors}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item Academic Chair of American Chemical Society, UIUC Chapter.
	\hfill\textbf{*}

	\item Oliver J.\ Bell Merit Scholar, Homer J.\ and Edith M.\ Birch
	Scholar
	\hfill\textbf{Aug. 2019}

	\item 2019 John E.\ Gieseking Scholar (for undergraduate research)
	\hfill\textbf{May 2019}

	\item Named ACS High Honors (Top 50 in the U.S.\ Chemistry Olympiad).
	\hfill\textbf{May 2018}
\end{itemize}
