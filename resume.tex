\end{itemize}

\subsection{Researcher and TA, University of Illinois at U-C
            \hfill Nov.\ 2018 -- *}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item \textbf{Hirata Group, 2019--*}: Furthered development of a novel
		stochastic technique in the evaluation of higher-order
		perturbation energies for very large molecular systems, termed
		\emph{Monte Carlo perturbation theory}.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Performed extensive re-factoring of the existing C++
				implementation of the algorithm.

			\item Implemented various numerical techniques
				including quadrature rules, the control variates
				method, and the explicit RK4 method via the
				NumPy Python library.

			\item Parsed, processed, and interpreted large numerical datasets
				via the NumPy and pandas Python libraries.

			\item Metaprogrammed scripts that automatically wrote and queued
				other job scripts to be run on the Blue Waters supercomputer at
				the NCSA.

	\item \textbf{Jain Group, 2018--2019}: Performed electronic impedance
		spectroscopy to characterize the superionic properties of twin-domain
		Cu$_2$S nanocrystals, a potential solid-state electrolyte for
		next-generation lithium-ion batteries.
